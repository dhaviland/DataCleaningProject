This project produces a data set derived from data collect from the
accelerometers in a Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description
is available at the site where the data was obtained:  

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

The data set for this project is located at:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

This file contains both the training and test data sets. Additionally a description of
the data can be found in the files:

    features_info.txt

Variable names are listed in:

    features.txt

The data present in the data set 

    dataSummary.txt

is the result of processing done by the script "run_analysis.R". It provides the 
mean values of each of the following original data set variables grouped according to
subject id and subject activity. See features_info.txt for a their discriptions.
